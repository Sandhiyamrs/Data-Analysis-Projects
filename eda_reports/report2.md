# Feature Distribution Analysis

## Numerical Features
- Feature1: Right-skewed distribution
- Feature2: Approximately normal
- Feature3: Contains mild outliers

## Outlier Detection
- IQR method identified ~2% extreme values
- No critical anomalies requiring removal

## Recommendations
- Apply standard scaling
- Keep outliers for model robustness
